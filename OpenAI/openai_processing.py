# The image shows a residential neighborhood with a clear blue sky. In the foreground, there\u2019s a landscaped yard with green grass and some flower beds.
# There are two houses visible; one is a two-story home with a distinctive roof, and the other is a single-story house next to it. 
# Trees surround the area, providing some shade, and the street appears to be quiet with well-maintained sidewalks. The overall atmosphere is peaceful and suburban. 

#4o PROMPT1
# "The image depicts a residential suburban neighborhood with a focus on two houses. The house on the left has a sloped brown roof and beige brick exterior. 
# The house on the right has a blue-grey exterior with white trim and a gabled roof. Both houses have front lawns with well-maintained grass and trees. 
# There's a clear blue sky and some sunlight casting shadows on the ground. A sidewalk runs along the front, bordered by a low hedge near the driveway of the left house."

#4o "Describe the atmosphere of this area." PROMT 4
# "The area appears to be a quiet, residential neighborhood with a peaceful atmosphere. The well-maintained houses and neatly trimmed lawns suggest a sense of community pride.
# The presence of mature trees provides ample shade and adds to the picturesque, suburban feel. It's likely a serene and family-friendly environment.",
